It has been a quite a while since I last posted something here, and I thought my most recent personal achievement deserves a post.

This week I reached 100k reputation points on Stack Overflow, the largest online community for professional programmers and enthusiasts.

In Stack Overflow terms, reputation points mean how much the content posted by a user is relevant and trusted by the community.
At the time of writing, there are over 14 million users registered in Stack Overflow and Iâ€™m sitting among the 100? users with over 100k reputation points.

But, at the end of the day, reputation points are just numbers. What really matters to me is how much I learned from this challenging (and addictive) experience. Answering on Stack Overflow contributed for me to become a better software engineer.

Over the past few years, I dedicated hundreds of hours of my personal time on Stack Overflow. During that time, I asked 25 questions and answered over 1100 questions.

To contrast with it, I cannot even count how many times Stack Overflow helped me out during my career and side projects over the years.

To be honest, since the past year I have not as active in Stack Overflow as I used to be. But I feel proud of myself for this achievement and even more proud for the time spent sharing my knowledge with the community.
