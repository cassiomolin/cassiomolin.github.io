It has been a quite a while since I last posted something here, and I thought my most recent personal achievement deserves a post.

This week I reached 100k reputation points on Stack Overflow, the largest online community for professional programmers and enthusiasts.

In Stack Overflow terms, reputation points mean how much the content posted by a user is relevant and trusted by the community.
At the time of writing, there are over 14 million users registered in Stack Overflow and Iâ€™m sitting among the 100? users with over 100k reputation points.

But, at the end of the day, reputation points are just numbers. What really matters to me is how much I learned from this (addictive) experience. Answering on Stack Overflow contributed for me to become a better software engineer.

Over the past few years, I dedicated hundreds of hours of my personal time on Stack Overflow. During that time, I asked 25 questions and answered over 1100 questions. And, in fairness, I haven't been able to answer much over the past year or so.

To contrast with it, I cannot even count how many times Stack Overflow helped me out during my career and side projects over these years.

While I feel proud of myself for this achievement, Stack Overflow has not simply been a quest for reputation. Answering on Stack Overflow has been about learning and helping other developers.
