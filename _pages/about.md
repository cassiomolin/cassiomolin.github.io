Hi there, my name is Cassio Mazzochi Molin.  
And this is my not-so-frequently-updated coding blog.

I am originally from Brazil, I descend from an Italian family, and I have been in Ireland since early 2015.

I've been developing software for over 11 years now, mainly with Java, and I currently work as Technical Lead for AIB, one of the largest banks in Ireland. If you would like to know more about my professional experience, please check out my [CV][cv].

I have been active on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] for many years now, having posted over 1,100 answers about HTTP, API design and Java in general. I currently sit on the [top 0.1% of the users with the highest reputation][100k], and some of my Stack Overflow [answers][stackoverflow.answers] inspired some of the posts you find in this blog.

If you feel generous enough to reward me for my contributions, either here or on Stack Overflow, you can [buy me a coffee][paypal] :)

During my free time, I usually try to do things that keep me away from the keyboards:

- I have been developing a sense of value in preparing good food. While everything seems rushed and moving so fast, I developed an appreciation for homemade food, mainly for food that takes time to prepare. It includes fresh pasta, risottos, long fermentation bread and pizzas (including sourdough). Good food is a way of bringing people together.

- I enjoy playing tabletop games and, over the past few years, I started collecting some titles I like the most. If I could pick some favourites, they would probably be [Viticulture][viticulture], [Everdell][everdell], [Wingspan][wingspan] and [7 Wonders][7wonders].

- I also have a great in interest in photography :)
