Hi there, my name is Cassio Mazzochi Molin.  
And this is my not-so-frequently-updated coding blog.

I am originally from Brazil, I descend from an Italian family, and I have been in Ireland since early 2015.

I've been developing software for over 11 years now, mainly with Java, and I currently work as Technical Lead for AIB, one of the largest banks in Ireland. If you would like to know more about my professional experience, please check out my [CV][cv].

I have been active on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] for many years now, having posted over 1,100 answers about HTTP, API design and Java in general. I currently sit on the [top 0.1% of the users with the highest reputation][100k], and some of my Stack Overflow [answers][stackoverflow.answers] inspired some of the posts you find in this blog.

If you feel generous enough to reward me for my contributions, either here or on Stack Overflow, you can [buy me a coffee][paypal] :)

Away from the keyboard, I have a passion for tabletop games, and over the past few years, I started collecting some titles I like the most. Tabletop games are a good reason for gathering friends around the table or even keeping myself entertained during the COVID-19 restrictions.
