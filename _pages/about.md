Hi there, my name is Cassio Mazzochi Molin.  
And this is my (not so frequently updated) coding blog.

I am originally from Brazil, I descend from an Italian family and I've been living in Ireland since early 2015. I've been developing software for over 11 years now, mainly with Java, and I currently work as Technical Lead for AIB, one of the largest banks in Ireland.

If you would like to know more about my professional experience, please have a look at [CV][cv].

I've been active on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] for many years now, posting over 1,100 answers about HTTP, API design and Java in general. I currently sit on the top 0.1% users with the highest reputation and some posts you will find in this blog are based on my Stack Overflow [answers][stackoverflow.answers]. And if you feel generous enough to reward me for my contributions, you can [buy me a coffee][paypal].

Out of curiosity, over the past few years I developed such a great passion for tabletop games and I started collecting some titles I like the most. It's a great reason for gathering friends around the table or keeping myself entertained during the COVID-19 restrictions.
