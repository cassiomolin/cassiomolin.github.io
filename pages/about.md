Hey! I'm Cassio and this is my coding blog!

I'm a software engineer with over ten years of experience in analysis, architecture and software development. I'm familiar with agile methodologies and I have the expertise to design, implement, test and deploy web applications in Java and JavaScript with React.

My skills include:

- Strong understanding of the REST architectural style with HTTP, microservices and containers with Docker.
- Solid background in systems architecture definition, best practices of software development, design patterns and testing.
- Experience with relational databases.

If you would like to check my professional experience, please have a look at [CV][cv]. I'm also open to freelancing, feel free to [get in touch][contact] and let's build something awesome!

I'm active on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow], currently sitting on the top 0.1% users. Some posts you will find in this blog are based on my Stack Overflow [answers][stackoverflow.answers]. I frequently find myself answering about REST, HTTP, API design and Java in general. And if you feel generous enough to reward me for my contributions, check my [Amazon wish list][amazon.wish-list] or simply [buy me a coffee][paypal].

And, in case you are wondering, I currently live in Dublin, Republic of Ireland.
