Hey! I’m Cassio and this is my programming insights collection. I'm a software engineer living, working and drinking in Ireland. I've been using Java for over 9 years now and I still love it.

As a spare time activity, I am active on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] and most of posts you'll find here are based on my Stack Overflow [answers][stackoverflow.answers]. I frequently find myself answering about REST, HTTP, API design and Java in general.

Interested in my professional experience? Have a look at my [CV][cv].<br/>
Would you like to get in touch? Feel free to [drop me a message][contact].
