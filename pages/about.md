I am Cassio Molin and I have been a software engineer in the past 9 years. I currently live in Dublin, Republic of Ireland.

As a spare time activity, I am active on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] and some posts you'll find here are based on my Stack Overflow [answers][stackoverflow.answers]. I frequently find myself answering about REST, HTTP, API design and Java in general.

Would you like to have a look at my professional experience? Feel free to check my [CV][cv].<br/>
Would you like to get in touch? [Drop me a message][contact]!<br>

And if you feel generous enough to reward me for my contributions, check my [Amazon wish list][amazon.wish-list] or simply [buy me a coffee][paypal].
