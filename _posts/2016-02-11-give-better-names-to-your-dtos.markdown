The [Java Language Specification][1] states the following regarding the [name convention for classes][2]:

> Names of class types should be descriptive nouns or noun phrases, not overly long, in mixed case with the first letter of each word capitalized.
>
> <!-- language: lang-java -->
>
>     ClassLoader
>     SecurityManager
>     Thread
>     Dictionary
>     BufferedInputStream
>
> [...]

Your [**D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bject][3] class names should follow the convention mentioned above.

Suffixing a class name with **DTO** or **Dto** is not really meaningful and doesn't tell much about the class itself. Try to give names that describe the purpose of your classes. Here are a few name suggestions you could use:

- _SomeSortOf_**Command**
- _SomeSortOf_**Configuration**
- _SomeSortOf_**Credentials**
- _SomeSortOf_**Details**
- _SomeSortOf_**Element**
- _SomeSortOf_**Event**
- _SomeSortOf_**Header**
- _SomeSortOf_**Instruction**
- _SomeSortOf_**Item**
- _SomeSortOf_**Message**
- _SomeSortOf_**Metadata**
- _SomeSortOf_**Operation**
- _SomeSortOf_**QueryParameter**
- _SomeSortOf_**QueryResult**
- _SomeSortOf_**Representation**
- _SomeSortOf_**Request**
- _SomeSortOf_**Response**
- _SomeSortOf_**Result**
- _SomeSortOf_**Row**
- _SomeSortOf_**Settings**
- _SomeSortOf_**Specification**
- _SomeSortOf_**Status**
- _SomeSortOf_**Summary**
- _SomeSortOf_**View**

<sup>**Note 1:** Whether acronyms will be handled as words or not, I guess it's up to you. Check the [Java API][4] and you will find some stumbles like [`ZipInputStream`][5] / [`GZIPInputStream`][6]. Both classes are in the [same package][7] and the name convention is not consistent. [`HttpURLConnection`][8] doesn't show any consistency with acronyms either.</sup>

<sup>**Note 2:** Some names listed above were borrowed from this [article][9] written by [Richard Dingwall][10].</sup>
