Still using the [RFC 2616][RFC 2616] as reference for the HTTP/1.1 protocol? It's more than time to **stop**! Seriously, forget it. **It's not relevant anymore.** 

I usually answer questions about HTTP on Stack Overflow and I'm surprised on how many developers still quote and use the old [RFC 2616][RFC 2616] as reference nowadays.

The HTTP/1.1 specification was inittially defined in the [RFC 2068][RFC 2068], released in January 1997. Improvements and updates to the HTTP/1.1 specification were released under the [RFC 2616][RFC 2616] in June 1999. In June 2014 the RFC 2616 was obsoleted for a whole new set of RFCs that collectively form the HTTP/1.1 specification:

- [RFC 7230][RFC 7230]: HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing
- [RFC 7231][RFC 7231]: HTTP/1.1: Semantics and Content
- [RFC 7232][RFC 7232]: HTTP/1.1: Conditional Requests
- [RFC 7233][RFC 7233]: HTTP/1.1: Range Requests
- [RFC 7234][RFC 7234]: HTTP/1.1: Caching
- [RFC 7235][RFC 7235]: HTTP/1.1: Authentication

These are the RFCs you must use as reference for the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
