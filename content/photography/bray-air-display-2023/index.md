The Bray Air Display is an annual event held in Bray, a seaside town in County Wicklow, Ireland. The airshow features a variety of aircraft, from vintage planes to modern aerobatic displays.

The event took place on both 29 and 30 July 2023, and I attended it on the 29th, a Saturday. There was some rain before the event, but then the sun came up, and I have a nice opportunity to register it my X-T4 paired with a XF 100-400mm lens.
