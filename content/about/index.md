Hi there, my name is Cassio Mazzochi Molin. I am originally from Brazil, I descend from an Italian family, and since early 2015 I have been living in Ireland.

I am a software engineer, and I have been developing software for 13+ years now, mainly with Java. Please take a moment to have a look at my [CV][cv] to learn more about my professional background.

I have been an active contributor on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] for many years, sharing my knowledge in 1,100+ answers about Java, HTTP, and API design. I'm among the [top 0.1% of users with the highest reputation][100k], and some of my Stack Overflow answers have served as inspiration for my [programming]-related posts.

If you appreciate my contributions, whether here or on Stack Overflow, you can show your support and [buy me a coffee][paypal].

I am into [photography] and you'll find some of my best photos in this website.

I have been developing a sense of value in preparing and appreciating good food. While everything seems rushed and moving so fast, I developed an appreciation for homemade food, mainly for food that takes time to prepare. It includes fresh pasta, risottos, long fermentation bread and pizzas (including sourdough). Good food is a way of bringing people together.

I also enjoy playing tabletop games and, over the past few years, I started collecting some titles I like the most. If I could pick some favourites, they would include [Viticulture][viticulture], [Everdell][everdell], [Wingspan][wingspan], and [7 Wonders][7wonders].
