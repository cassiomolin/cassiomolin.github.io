Hey, I'm Cassio, a sofware enginner living, working and drinking in Ireland.

Welcome to my programming insights collection! Most of posts you find here are based on my [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] answers. I put lots of effort in my Stack Overflow posts, but I'm particularly proud of this [answer][best-answer] about token-based authentication in JAX-RS applications.

I'm also a cooking and wine enthusiast and passionate about drones and photography.
