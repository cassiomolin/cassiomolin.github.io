This is the source code of my [website][cassiomolin], where I publish some insights about software development.

- It's built on the top of [GitHub Pages][github-pages] with [Jekyll][jekyll].
- It uses a modified version of the [Slate][slate] template from [Pixelarity][pixelarity].
- The beautiful images that illustrate my posts come from [Unsplash][unsplash].
- Most of the content is based on my answers from [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow].
- The contact form is built on the top of [Google Apps Script][google-apps-script] following a solution described [here][form-instructions].
