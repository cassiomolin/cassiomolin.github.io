# Insights by cassiomolin

This is the source code of my [website][cassiomolin], where I publish some insights about software development.

Here are some facts about it:

- It is built on the top of [GitHub Pages][github-pages] with [Jekyll][jekyll].
- I usually use [plain Git commands][git-cheat-sheet] to manage the content. Sometimes I use [Siteleaf][siteleaf].
- This website uses a customised version of the [Slate][slate] template from [Pixelarity][pixelarity].
- The beautiful images that illustrate my posts come from [Unsplash][unsplash].
- Images have been cropped using [Croppola][croppola] and resized and compressed using [ImageResize.org][imageresize-org].
- Most of the content is based on my answers from [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow].
- The contact form is built on the top of [Google Apps Script][google-apps-script] following a solution described [here][form-instructions].

Some stuff I still need to work on:

 - Allow comments (probably using [Disqus][disqus]).
 - Search posts (probably using a [Google Custom Search][]).
 - Improve performance by using responsive images (approach described [here][responsive-images-approach]).
